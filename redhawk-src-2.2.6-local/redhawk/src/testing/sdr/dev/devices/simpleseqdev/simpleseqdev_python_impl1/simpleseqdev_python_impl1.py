        Basic functionality:

        StreamSRI:
            To create a StreamSRI object, use the following code:
                self.sri = BULKIO.StreamSRI(1, 0.0, 0.0, BULKIO.UNITS_TIME, 0, 0.0, 0.0, BULKIO.UNITS_NONE, 0, self.stream_id, [])

            To create a PrecisionUTCTime object, use the following code:
                tmp_time = time.time()
                wsec = math.modf(tmp_time)[1]
                fsec = math.modf(tmp_time)[0]
                tstamp = BULKIO.PrecisionUTCTime(BULKIO.TCM_CPU, BULKIO.TCS_VALID, 0, wsec, fsec)
  
        Ports:

            Each port instance is accessed through members of the following form: self.port_<PORT NAME>
            
            Data is obtained in the process function through the getPacket call (BULKIO only) on a
            provides port member instance. The getPacket function call is non-blocking - if no data
            is available, it will return immediately with all values == None.
            
            To send data, call the appropriate function in the port directly. In the case of BULKIO,
            convenience functions have been added in the port classes that aid in output.
            
            Interactions with non-BULKIO ports are left up to the component developer's discretion.
            
        Properties:
        
            Properties are accessed directly as member variables. If the property name is baudRate,
            then accessing it (for reading or writing) is achieved in the following way: self.baudRate.
            
        Example:
        
            # This example assumes that the component has two ports:
            #   - A provides (input) port of type BULKIO.dataShort called dataShort_in
            #   - A uses (output) port of type BULKIO.dataFloat called dataFloat_out
            # The mapping between the port and the class if found in the component
            # base class.
            # This example also makes use of the following Properties:
            #   - A float value called amplitude
            #   - A boolean called increaseAmplitude
            
            data, T, EOS, streamID, sri, sriChanged, inputQueueFlushed = self.port_dataShort_in.getPacket()
            
            if data == None:
                return NOOP
                
            outData = range(len(data))
            for i in range(len(data)):
                if self.increaseAmplitude:
                    outData[i] = float(data[i]) * self.amplitude
                else:
                    outData[i] = float(data[i])
                
            // NOTE: You must make at least one valid pushSRI call
            if sriChanged:
                self.port_dataFloat_out.pushSRI(sri);
            }
